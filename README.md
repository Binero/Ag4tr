A Fabric mod for Minecraft Java Edition.
An addon for Tech Reborn adding Additional Gear. This mod's general premise is to bring back some features from the mod that Tech Reborn was inspired by: IndustrialCraft 2. It has got some miscellaneous, "original" features, too, though, such as, for now, a complete rubber armor set as well as an electronic lighter.
 Boots.
 
 This mod includes an API for modmakers of sorts, namely the HazmatUtils class, which includes methods that check whether a PlayerEntity is wearing a partial or full (the suit hasn't got a boots piece, so that means: helm, chest and pants) Hazmat suit. The chestpiece's class also includes public methods that allow to set and check the Air level inside its tanks.
