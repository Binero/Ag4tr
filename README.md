# Ag4tr
A Fabric mod for Minecraft Java Edition.
An addon for Tech Reborn adding Additional Gear. This mod's general premise is to grant players access to the QuantumSuit's "powers" way before they're at a point where they can acquire one. It, however, has got some miscellaneous features too, such as a complete rubber armor set and a strong shield.
Some of its features are inspired by the same mod that TR was insipired by - IndustrialCraft 2.
